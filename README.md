# 👥 Credits

People / repositories I have copied / learned from:

- [fufexan/dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) for the configuration structure
- [jacekpoz/nixos](https://git.jacekpoz.pl/poz/niksos) for learning how NixOS modules work

Some bits have also been borrowed from within the configuration, and credit has been given when its due.
