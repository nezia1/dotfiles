#+TITLE: nezia's dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for configuring my workstation. I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to manage them, hence why everything is under its own module, so I can use ~stow *~ to symlink them to the right place.

* Theme
I use [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][catppuccin]] as my theme (the mocha variant). I love the soothing pastel colors. The GTK theme and the Qt5 theme are also configured to be used with supported applications.

* Software used
- Operating system: [[https://archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]
- Window manager: [[https://hyprland.org][Hyprland]]
- Status bar: [[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar][Waybar]]
- Application launcher: [[https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/][wofi]]
- Terminal emulator: [[https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty][kitty]]
- Shell: [[https://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] with [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh My Zsh]]
- Text editor: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]
- Notification daemon: [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][dunst]]
- Password manager: [[https://keepassxc.org/][KeePassXC]]

Hyprland is configured to use a random wallpaper from the ~~​/.dotfiles~ directory, so you need to have your wallpapers in it.
